                    Whether you have a green thumb or not, you're probably privy to the many benefits of live plants. They can help purify the air, reduce stress, and even boost your productivity. And let's not overlook their ability to create visual interest in your home. That said, finding the right plant can be quite challenging, as there are countless easy-to-care-for varieties that can breathe life into your space. From fiddle leaf fig trees that don't require a ton of water to striking palm plants that will take you back to your last beach getaway, here are 10 of the best aesthetic plants you can find online right now.
                    If you favor a more-is-more design approach, you'll appreciate this plant's distinct disposition that can enliven the dreariest of spaces. Just be sure to water them regularly and keep them in a bright spot.
                    As is common with many other succulent plants humidity is not important. However, they do like good ventilation so avoid very tight "airless" corners of your home.
