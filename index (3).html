we have created a site in which we have provided information
about various types of plants.With the help of this site anyone 
can book his/her plant and it will be delivered within 48 hours
to his/her home.
Plants are one of six big groups of living things. They are autotrophic
which means they have complex cells and make their own food.
Plants include familiar types such as trees,herbs,bushes,grasses,ferms 
and green algae.
Most popular plants grow in the ground, with stems in the air and roots 
below the surface.
A plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make food by photosynthesis. A green substance in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the Sun needed to make food. Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside plastids, which are inside the leaf cells. The leaf can be thought of as a food factory. Leaves of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots.


The word "plant" can also mean the action of putting something in the ground. For example, farmers plant seeds in the field.

Photosynthesis is a process that is taken place by the leaves on the plant. The leaves are the only parts of a plant that can do this process (as they adapted). This is also known as how the plant gets its food.
The roots of plants perform two main functions. First, they anchor the plant to the ground. Second, they absorb water and various nutrients dissolved in water from the soil. Plants use the water to make food. The water also provides the plant with support. Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their leaves. Plants which specialise in desert areas are called xerophytes or phreatophytes, depending on the type of root growth.
For plants to reproduce and make seeds, they need pollen grains transferred from one plant to another. Plants can receive pollen from the same plant type or species to produce seeds. Brightly coloured plants and flowers attract small animals or insects that act as pollen carriers. Also known as pollinators, these pick pollen and carry it from one plant to another. Some plants may be pollinated by the wind, while others rely on bees and butterflies. When butterflies land on flowers, pollen sticks to their bodies and carry them to the next flower.<br>
