                <p>
                    Native to Mexico, poinsettias are in the Euphorbia family and are a popular holiday plant because of their colorful bracts (leaves). There is also a species that is used as a cut flower. They are most commonly used for decorating during the winter holidays, but are also attractive as green plants throughout the year.<br>Poinsettias change color in response to shorter winter days. Poinsettia flowers are actually made up of the bracts, which look like petals, and the tiny yellow flowers in the center, called cyathia. The colorful bracts attract insects to the flowers and will drop after pollination.<br>Poinsettias are not harmful to animal or human health. But they should not be eaten.<br>The sticky white sap can cause a skin rash, so gloves are recommended when working with these plants.
                    Avoid contact with eyes and mouth. Wash tools well after use as the sap can make tools sticky.
