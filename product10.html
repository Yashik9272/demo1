                    With huge, glossy, dark green leaves, Monstera deliciosa, also known by its common name “Swiss cheese plant,” is a striking addition to any room. It’s a woody vine that grows in the tropics of North and South America, where it can reach 70 feet tall. But it’s also a popular houseplant because it’s generally unfussy and has few pests or diseases. Its gorgeous leaves, which develop holes that give it its whimsical name, may grow up to three feet wide! It's a great plant for newbies and experienced plant people alike.
                    Monstera deliciosa likes moderate indoor temperatures of 60 to 85 degrees. It prefers high humidity, but it will adapt fine to dry indoor conditions. If you really feel like nurturing it, you can mist it occasionally to boost humidity—but it’s not entirely necessary. Water a Swiss cheese plant until it runs out the bottom (make sure your pot has drain holes! No plant likes wet feet!), then wait until the top few inches feel dry before watering again. Don't overwater—that's a common mistake with this plant. Monstera deliciosa likes its soil a little on the dry side. If you like, feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer in the summer, then stop over the winter when it’s not actively growing.
                    You can take Monstera deliciosa outdoors in summer, or keep it outdoors in warm climates (it’s often grown as a landscape plant in warm climates such as Florida). Place it in an area with filtered shade, never direct sunlight, so the leaves won’t fry. Bring it back indoors before temperatures drop into the 40s.
                    Small plants may be staked with a moss-covered pole, which they will climb. The leaf size increases as the plants get going. If you don’t stake, you’ll have more of a sprawling plant, which is also fine. In the wild, the Swiss cheese plant produces fruit, but that's rare as a houseplant.
