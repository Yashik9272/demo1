                <h1>Haworthia Zebra plant</h1>
                <p>
                    Haworthias are dainty succulent houseplants and are frequently compared and confused with Aloes, and Gasteria plants, this is hardly surprising since they're all members of the Asphodeloideae family. However, unlike Aloes, Haworthias are almost always small and very (very) slow growing plants.

                    They don't need much fuss or care and can even go many weeks without water if required. They also tend to look brilliant in unusual containers or interesting soil mixes.
                    H. limifolia has ridged and normally more triangular chunky firm shaped leaves. They have prominent solid ridges that line the outside of the leaves (last picture in the gallery and the first plant in the photo below).
                    
                    Perhaps the most popular varieties are H. attenuata and H. fasciata, both are commonly known as the Zebra Cactus
                    Haworthias are reasonably adaptable plants that that will take various light conditions, but neither direct sunlight nor deep shade. Direct sunlight will make the leaves of all Haworthia's go an ugly red, purple or brown colour. Move to a shady spot and if the damage isn't too bad these colourings will fade over time.
                    A surviving plant will get by with watering just once a month, however to get the plant thriving it will need to be done at least once a fortnight, possibly once a week in very warm temperatures.
                    
                    Either way, water well and then only water again when the soil has largely dried out. These plants are very tolerant of underwatering but will succumb quickly to rotting if overwatered.
                    
                    Make sure you try your best to keep water out of the crown or rosette of the plant, in cool temperatures doing this will again encourage rotting.
