                    The snake plant, commonly referred to as mother-in-law’s tongue, is a resilient succulent that can grow anywhere between 6 inches to several feet.
                    In addition to providing a bit of ambiance, snake plants have a number of health benefits.
                    Similar to other household succulents, snake plants help to filter indoor air. What’s unique about this particular plant is that it’s one of the few plants that can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen at night.
                    This quality makes it an ideal plant for bedroom decor as it can help regulate healthy airflow.
                    Snake plants are often used as home decor, as they’re pleasing to the eye, easy to care for, and require little water to survive.
                    These plants are considered to be relatively safe, but they’re mildly toxic if consumed. Their leaves contain a poison that can cause swelling and numbness on the tongue if eaten in large doses. It’s wise to keep this plant away from children and animals that are prone to nibble.
